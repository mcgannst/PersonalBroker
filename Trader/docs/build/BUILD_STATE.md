# Trader Build State

Shared state for the gauntlet build. Rules: [`../plans/2026-09-26-build-master-plan.md`](../plans/2026-09-26-build-master-plan.md) §3. Only the orchestrator edits the header, the board and the escalations. Every agent appends to the activity log with a single `cat >> ... <<'EOF'` command. Never write secrets here.

## Activity log

### 2026-09-27T04:05:00Z · SETUP · Orchestrator · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: master plan and Phase 1 plan written; state file created; build not started
- Commits: (this commit)
- Notes: Phase 0 checks S2 (quote freshness) and live S4 are assumed to pass, per Stephen. FinanceTracker token independence is assumed confirmed.

### 2026-09-27T04:13:00Z · P1-T1 · Orchestrator · attempt 1 · started
- Result: build started by Stephen ("gauntlet it"; run all phases without stopping, report progress)
- Notes: Docker Desktop running; token refreshed 03:36Z (fresh)

### 2026-09-27T04:13:28Z · P1-T1 · Builder · attempt 1 · started
- Result: starting plan steps 1-10

### 2026-09-27T04:17:24Z · P1-T1 · Builder · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: done, all 10 plan steps complete and ticked
- Commits: 8cae90d, cf0ad8e
- Gate: check.sh passed (4 tests)
- Notes: uv 0.12.19, Python 3.12.14. Two lint/type fixes to plan code: test_missing_required_value_fails uses pydantic.ValidationError (ruff B017 rejects bare Exception), and get_env() drops an unused type-ignore (mypy strict). .env.dev: MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL renamed, APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY and SESSION_SECRET added, rerun is a no-op. notify.py sent. The hook also blocks a standalone change-directory call, so used uv --directory and absolute paths.

### 2026-09-27T04:18:23Z · P1-T1 · Verifier · attempt 1 · started
- Notes: pulling trunk, checking git status, running check.sh and plan checkboxes

### 2026-09-27T04:18:46Z · P1-T1 · Verifier · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: PASS
- Commits: none (read-only), verified at dea2fdb
- Gate: check.sh passed (ruff, format, mypy clean, 4 tests passed)
- Notes: git pull --rebase refused only because of the orchestrator's uncommitted BUILD_STATE.md, git fetch showed trunk equal to origin/trunk. All 10 P1-T1 checkboxes ticked. trader-dev.sh version prints 0.1.0. Untracked .DS_Store files at repo root and .claude/ (not task files)

### 2026-09-27T04:55:00Z · P1-T2/T4/T5 · Orchestrator · attempt 1 · started
- Result: Stephen asked for more parallel agents. Builders now run in their own worktrees and push to trunk. Tasks start once their dependencies pass the Verifier. Up to 5 builders.
- Notes: P1-T1 passed the Verifier. Its Breaker and both reviewers run now, in parallel with the builders of T2, T4, T5.

- Result: in progress
- Notes: worktree agent-aab8816de0bf0bf93

### 2026-09-27T04:22:01Z · P1-T1 · Code reviewer · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: PASS (0 must-fix, 3 should-fix, 5 nits)
- Commits: reviewed 8cae90d, cf0ad8e
- Findings: should-fix config.py:16-17 DB URLs (with passwords) are plain str so repr leaks them. should-fix env_setup.py:24 SESSION_SECRET appended without leading newline, can merge into an unterminated last line. should-fix notify.py:25-26 Telegram failure prints failed but exits 0, HTTP errors give a raw traceback. Nits: temp file not removed on write failure (env_setup.py:27-31), import-time env read (notify.py:11), CRLF/quoted values in notify regex (notify.py:15), build/ scripts outside ruff/mypy, docstring cites non-existent trader.settings_store
- Notes: temp file pattern docker/.env.* is git-ignored, mkstemp gives 0600, urlopen has a timeout

### 2026-09-27T04:22:09Z · P1-T1 · Spec reviewer · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: PASS (0 must-fix, 0 should-fix, 4 nits)
- Commits: reviewed 8cae90d, cf0ad8e
- Findings: code matches plan verbatim apart from the two declared deviations, both correct. Nits - tenacity (SPEC §2) not yet a dependency, ADMIN_USERNAME/ADMIN_PASSWORD_INITIAL (SPEC §13) not in EnvSettings, EnvSettings.questrade_refresh_token outlives P1-T6 token-ownership rule, test-side type-ignore[call-arg] now stale (tests are not mypy-checked)
- Notes: .env.dev confirmed git-ignored (Trader/.gitignore:2), not read

### 2026-09-27T04:23:11Z · P1-T1 · Breaker · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: FAIL (2 of 8 new tests fail)
- Commits: f5b6daa
- Gate: ruff, format, mypy pass. pytest 10 passed, 2 failed (the breaker tests below)
- Findings: (1) test_database_password_never_leaks_via_repr_str_or_json - database_url and migration_database_url are plain str, so repr/str/model_dump_json of EnvSettings expose the DB passwords. (2) test_env_setup_handles_file_without_trailing_newline - env_setup.py appends SESSION_SECRET onto the last line when .env.dev has no trailing newline, corrupting APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY.
- Notes: tests use fake values and a tmp copy of .env only

### 2026-09-27T04:23:34Z · P1-T4 · Builder · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: done, all 5 plan steps complete and ticked
- Commits: 59be3e7
- Gate: ruff, format and mypy pass. The P1-T4 tests pass (11). Before commit: 15/15 passed. On trunk after rebase: 28 passed, 2 failed. Both failures are P1-T1 Breaker tests in tests/gauntlet/test_p1_t1_breaker.py (DB password in the EnvSettings repr, env_setup without a trailing newline), not P1-T4 code.
- Notes: exchange_calendars 4.13.2 with pandas 3.0.6 works with the plan's code as written, with no API changes. The early-close (11-27 18:00 UTC) and DST values match the calendar. There are no deviations.

### 2026-09-27T04:24:05Z · P1-T1 · Builder · attempt 2 · started
- Result: fixing gauntlet findings (SecretStr DB URLs, env_setup trailing newline, notify.py errors, test_config nits)

### 2026-09-27T04:24:35Z · P1-T4 · Verifier · attempt 1 · started
- Notes: verifying in worktree agent-a3af73294d32568cd

### 2026-09-27T04:24:59Z · P1-T5 · Builder · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: done, all 11 plan steps ticked
- Commits: be6fa8d (parser), 1813101 (scraper), 2dae157 (switch to shared ET import)
- Gate: check.sh 33 passed, 2 failed (only the known P1-T1 gauntlet tests), 12 adapter tests pass
- Notes: parser and scraper code exactly as planned. All expected values matched the spike, no parser fixes needed. ET was defined locally at first because P1-T4 was not on trunk yet, then switched to trader.market.clock once it landed.

### 2026-09-27T04:25:23Z · P1-T4 · Verifier · attempt 1 · finished
- Result: PASS
- Commits: verified trunk at f04624d (P1-T4 code 59be3e7)
- Gate: ruff, format, mypy clean. pytest 33 passed, 2 failed, and both failures are the known P1-T1 breaker tests (password repr leak, env trailing newline). P1-T4 tests 11 passed
- Findings: git status clean, all 5 P1-T4 plan steps ticked, all 8 listed files present on trunk

### 2026-09-27T04:25:28Z · P1-T5 · Verifier · attempt 1 · started
